#  This indicates that all connecting users must present a certificate.

# plain[passwd=/etc/ocserv/ocpasswd,otp=/etc/ocserv/users.otp]
#  The plain option requires specifying a password file which contains
# entries of the following format.
# "username:groupname1,groupname2:encoded-password"
# One entry must be listed per line, and 'ocpasswd' should be used
# to generate password entries. The 'otp' suboption allows to specify
# an oath password file to be used for one time passwords; the format of
# the file is described in https://code.google.com/p/mod-authn-otp/wiki/UsersFile
#
# radius[config=/etc/radiusclient/radiusclient.conf,groupconfig=true,nas-identifier=name,override-interim-updates=false]:
#  The radius option requires specifying freeradius-client configuration
# file. If the groupconfig option is set, then config-per-user will be overriden,
# and all configuration will be read from radius. The 'override-interim-updates' if set to
# true will ignore Acct-Interim-Interval from the server and 'stats-report-time' will be considered.
#
# gssapi[keytab=/etc/key.tab,require-local-user-map=true,tgt-freshness-time=900]
#  The gssapi option allows to use authentication methods supported by GSSAPI,
# such as Kerberos tickets with ocserv. It should be best used as an alternative
# to PAM (i.e., have pam in auth and gssapi in enable-auth), to allow users with
# tickets and without tickets to login. The default value for require-local-user-map
# is true. The 'tgt-freshness-time' if set, it would require the TGT tickets presented
# to have been issued within the provided number of seconds. That option is used to
# restrict logins even if the KDC provides long time TGT tickets.
